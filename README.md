# duck-to-py
Simple Python script to take python scripts and convert them to be used in in ducky script

This script adds all the `STRING/STRINGLN` and `ENTER` statements for quickly creating python script files using a Ducky Script device.

This allows you to create the file locally on the machine if you cannot download it from a remote source.

simply put your python script in main.txt run the main.py and then check output.txt and there will be a python script converted.

`STRINGLN.py` uses `STRINGLN` rather than `STRING` `ENTER`
